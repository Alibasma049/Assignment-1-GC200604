For my project, I would like to create a JavaFX program that shows how much coffee I (or anyone else) drink per day and of which type. I will have an AWS MySQL database where I will record simple data like date, coffee type, (e.g., espresso, latte, iced), and cups. When the program is started, it will show a chart of cups per day or per coffee type. There will also be a button to switch to a TableView of all entries.

Why I Picked This:
I consume a great deal of coffee and thought it would be a fun project to turn it into a simple application. It's relatable and personal, and I can learn about JavaFX and databases while tracking something that I'm actually interested in.

Planned Features:

A graph of coffee trends (e.g., what kind I drink most).

A TableView of all coffee entries.

CSS that will give the app soft colors and coffee-style theming.
A little coffee cup icon on the app window.

All data stored and pulled from a remote MySQL database.
